# ex07-grey-box

        As you learned in the last lecture we can use Grey-Box Optimization to make the hyperparameter search more efficient. 


### Installation 
For this exercise you will need to get the data from [1]. To download the datasets for the FC-Net benchmark:

    wget http://ml4aad.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fcnet_tabular_benchmarks.tar.gz
    tar xf fcnet_tabular_benchmarks.tar.gz
    
Store them under data/fcnet_tabular_benchmarks.
